It’s just a big book everyone can access to review all transactions that ever took place. This book is programmed to balance at any time. So for you to send 20$ worth of crappy-coin to your friend Paul, the complete history of how this 20$ worth of crappy-coin came into your possession needs to be right since its birth in crypto-edden (also called the “<strong>Genesis block</strong>” or “<strong>block 0</strong>”) and through all transactions that’s ever occurred until it found its way to your pocket.

It is the first blockchain platform to evolve out of a scientific philosophy and a research-first driven approach. The development team consists of a large global collective of expert engineers and researchers. Also, Cardano is developing a <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_contract' target='new'>smart contract</a> platform which seeks to deliver more advanced features than any protocol previously developed.

  "learn_pos_text": "<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_stake' target='new'>Proof of Stake</a> (<strong>PoS</strong>) is the consensus mechanism through which transactions are validated before being added to the blockchain. This process takes place without direct human interactions. And that’s a good thing. This mechanism can be implemented in a myriad of ways following different ideologies and schools of thought. But the main idea is that participating actors, also called “<strong>forgers</strong>”, have to pledge a number of their coins to support the network as well as being chosen to process the next transaction block. Your chance of being elected is tied to the portion of the total pledged coins that your stake represents. Once you get elected, your computer will write the transaction block on the blockchain and share the news. You can then receive transaction fees or a reward, based on the system implementation. The theory behind <strong>PoS</strong> is that a bad actor attempting to push malicious transactions on the blockchain would lose its stake, or at the very least, devalue its worth by undermining the confidence people have in the system.",

  "learn_pow_text": "Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency that came in action, uses a <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_work' target='new'>Proof of Work</a> (<strong>PoW</strong>) consensus mechanism. So, in order to write transactions to the blockchain in a <strong>PoW</strong> network, you need to solve very hard mathematical equations. To do so, you need specialized hardware since it is not realistically feasible by the human brain. Groups of people called “<strong>miners</strong>” are competing against each other to solve those equations. Whoever gets the right solution first will reap the reward. What happens if you’re first but not right? You end up in a parallel chain, a forked chain, a parallel world where you still have your reward in your wallet, but since no one followed you on your trip to this fresh new world, well… good luck spending it… cheater!",
  "pos_vs_pow": "PoS vs PoW, which one is better?",
  "learn_vs_text1": "Actually, cryptocurrency like Bitcoin are using a lot of energy to secure the network through the <strong>PoW</strong> consensus. Since electricity around the globe isn’t always very green, this became a problem. Mining operations require an enormous quantity of specialized <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application-specific_integrated_circuit' target='new'>ASIC</a> mining rigs to stay competitive as the difficulty level is rising. Because of the fast evolving pace of the technology, mining rigs quickly become obsolete and can hardly be of  any other use. Which is a complete waste in my sense. Since you always need more computing power to stay in the game, there is less and less room for small operators, meaning that the network is currently centralizing around few mining operators. I could also argue that the <strong>PoW</strong> process takes too much time, that the number of transactions per seconds is too low, which makes this solution hardly scalable. But I think that these last issues can be fixed while the hardware and energy waste is hopeless by design.",
  "learn_vs_text2": "A rising number of cryptocurrencies are now choosing proof of stake as a validation system. As an investor, you can use low-end hardware to participate in these networks, meaning low energy requirements, no need to upgrade your hardware quite as much and, most of all, a smaller footprint in your own house. All these factors create better accessibility for any passionate/amateur/true nerds (...that's me) who would like to be a part of this economic revolution.",
  "learn_vs_text3": "Sure, Bitcoin remained secure over the past 10 years and has proven itself with <strong>PoW</strong>. But this does not mean that we can’t get <strong>PoS</strong> as secure and more efficient. One can argue that <strong>PoS</strong> will make the rich even richer since they have more to invest in the system and therefore, a greater chance to process blocks. But this very issue is the same in <strong>PoW</strong> if you want more processing power to mine efficiently. It is also true in every investment you could actually think of, even outside of cryptocurrencies.",

All of them have a worth equal to zero. And it is the same old story that’s still playing today. In an attempt to fix our flawed system, our government multiplied economic rescue plans. How do they do so? They create a large amount of their own currency and hand it over to individuals, businesses, etc. While this helps at the moment, it has a drawback effect. Inflating the currency supply decreases its unit value, lowering our purchasing power at the same time. It’s like keeping our economic system on an artificial respirator that is plugged on a dying battery. Do it too often and the whole system will crumble.",
  "learn_care_text2": "Cryptocurrencies open a new world of possibilities. The rules of the game can be fixed in an open protocol for all to see. The total supply that will ever be can be fixed from the start, forcing us to search for a real solution instead of falling for the quick fix of inflating the supply. With governance rules, voting mechanisms and treasury built inside the protocol, this technology could go a long way. No one can tell now if this is the solution. But I know one thing, this has never been tried before and I don’t feel like repeating history again.",

Cloud services insure you to run your service without interruption. The downside is that many nodes are geographically regrouped in the same area.",
  "project_myproject_text10": "The Cons:",
  "project_myproject_text11": "<strong>Not top rated availability</strong>: Running a node on a home network cannot guarantee the best internet availability since you rely on only one service provider.",
  "project_myproject_text12": "<strong>Harder to win slot battle</strong>: When two nodes are competing for the same slot, the first one to spread its block through the network wins. By operating in a remote area, it could potentially be harder to compete against nodes located within large centers or hosted within the same cloud services.",
  "what_a_stakepool": "What is a stake pool?",
  "project_what_stakepool_text1": "A stake pool is a network node with a public address for users to delegate to. Stake pools are run by a reliable operator: an individual or business with the knowledge and resources to run the node on a consistent basis. Ada holders can then delegate to stake pools if they wish to participate in the protocol and receive rewards, but do not wish to operate a network node themselves.",
  "project_what_stakepool_text2": "The more stake delegated to a stake pool, the greater chance it has of being selected as a slot leader. Each time it is selected, it is rewarded, and these rewards are shared between the stake pool operator and stake pool delegates.

  "what_delegation": "What is delegation?",
  "project_delegation_text1": "Delegation is the process by which ada holders delegate the stake associated with their ada to a stake pool. It allows ada holders that do not have the skills or desire to run a node to participate in the network and be rewarded in proportion to the amount of stake delegated.

  "project_tesnet_text2": "Each era brings a different set of features that slowly brings us closer to the final goal, which is a complete self-sustaining ecosystem governed by its stakeholders.

  "how_choose_pool": "How to choose the right pool?",
  "project_choosepool_text1": "There are some metrics to consider in order to maximise your rewards.",
  "project_choosepool_text2": "You first need to know that stake pools actually have a saturation point that prevent them to represent more than a certain percentage of the total amount of staked Ada. Stake rewards will decrease as a stake pool reaches its saturation point, incentivizing delegators to seek other stake pools. Although this is currently being debated among stake pool operators, this limit has been set to ensure decentralization of the system.",
  "project_choosepool_text3": "Smaller pools have a lesser chance of being elected as slot leader to mint new blocks, but at the same time, your stake will represent a larger part of the reward when that pool will actually get elected.",
  "project_choosepool_text4": "There is the “Pool performance” factor. Pools operators need to ensure that their pools are available on the network almost 100% of the time. Pools are scheduled by an algorithm to produce a block at a certain time, there is no reward for those who are late..!",
  "project_choosepool_text5": "And now we are left with the obvious, stake pool fees. Those are set by the operator. They could be a fixed fee or a percentage fee. Those fees will be deducted from the total reward earned by the stake pool during an <a href='https://docs.cardano.org/technical/#high-level-overview' target='new'>epoch</a>. The rewards are distributed among all delegators at the end of each epoch.",
  "project_choosepool_text6": "Conclusion, find a good operator that fits your conviction and who you can trust. And find a second choice in case the first pool is saturated..!",
